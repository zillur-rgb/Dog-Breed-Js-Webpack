### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Webpack

### What I learned

So I just learned how webpack works and I thought why don't I make a page using what I have learned. I know there is still a lot of area where it can be developed but as a new learner of Webpack I think this is a lot for me.

### Continued development

I might use a Framework and develop this more in future.
